# `state-to-shadowrepo`: The idea of turning external state into a 'shadowrepo'

- The idea of doing more with a big feature from a big site is easy and intuitive to understand. It just 'clicks', just like a chrome extension.
- State from a third-party platform can be collected and made accessible as a shadowrepo that does not really exist but is dynamically generated.
- Works for both X state as well as GitHub State (or any other state)
- Great tool that benefits SEO and organisation for superdevs

Start with lists, this is the biggest impact. Low hanging after that is from state I already had: discussions, issues, prs, and other things.
