@openapi.yaml
please create a beautiful parallel-style landingpage for this extractor (hosted at same origin), that first sells the service in simple minimalistic way with CTA to login, then after being logged in (using oauth provider), show form to fill hostname or website url, which should submit it to the api with the api key.

this is going to be a tool for parallel.ai so design it appropriately
