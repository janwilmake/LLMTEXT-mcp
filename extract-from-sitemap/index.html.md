@openapi.yaml
please create a beautiful parallel-style landingpage for this extractor (hosted at same origin), that first sells the service in simple minimalistic way with CTA to login, then after being logged in (using oauth provider), show form to fill hostname or website url, which should submit it to the api with the api key.

this is going to be a tool for parallel.ai so design it appropriately

- the input type shouldnt' be url for hostname to work
- the submit button doesn't actually submit right, please ensure it actually starts calling the api and shows a nice loading indicator. as loading indicator, use the parallel icon in a spin animation
- use cdn.tailwindcss.com to save tokens instead of css, its cleaner
