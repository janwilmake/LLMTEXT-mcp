# Further refinements

- ✅ LLMtext by parallel (-> read blogpost)
- Link to llms.txt files (ask Tina)
- ⏳ Move to `parallel-web/llmtext-mcp` with website https://llmtext.com and description `Turn Your Docs into a Dedicated MCP Server`
- ⏳ For professionally linking it to Parallel, put social login at https://login.llmtext.com with Parallel X Account
- Highlight the social element more: top 10 users per server + overall top 10 leaderboard
- Give people an option to opt-out of the social element before logging in with X (for simplicity, login with X remains required)
- Make it OSS and easy to host yourself. Invite contributions.

# Blog

- Why this is better than context7
- Reasoning over a table of contents > vector search?
- Every website needs an llms.txt, not just docs
- Parallel.ai llms.txt combines main website + docs + socials
